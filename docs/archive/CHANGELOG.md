# 📝 Documentation Changelog

This file tracks the evolution of NextRush documentation structure.

## 🚀 July 2025 - Complete Documentation Restructure

### **Goals Achieved**

- ✅ **Professional developer psychology approach** - Root README for attraction, docs/ for reference
- ✅ **Comprehensive feature coverage** - All implemented features documented
- ✅ **Removed false claims** - Only real features documented (no app.validate(), app.xssProtection(), etc.)
- ✅ **Organized structure** - Feature-specific guides with consistent formatting
- ✅ **Developer-friendly examples** - Working code samples throughout

### **New Documentation Structure**
