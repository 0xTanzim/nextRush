Title: 🎓 Complete NextRush v1.0 Learning Project - Archive as Educational Milestone

Description:
This PR marks the completion of NextRush v1.0 as a learning project and prepares it for archival.

## 📚 Learning Project Summary

This was my **first attempt** at building a Node.js web framework and publishing an NPM package. The primary goal was education, not production use.

### ✅ Educational Objectives Achieved:
- Framework architecture and design patterns
- Plugin-based system development
- TypeScript advanced features and patterns
- Performance testing and benchmarking
- NPM package development and publishing
- Open source project management

### 📊 Final Results:
- **Performance**: 1,400 RPS (competitive with established frameworks)
- **Memory**: 75MB usage, zero leaks detected
- **Features**: Complete Express.js compatibility + built-in features
- **Dependencies**: Zero external packages
- **Documentation**: 25+ comprehensive guides
- **Testing**: Professional benchmark suite

### 🧠 Key Lessons Learned:
1. **Architecture First**: Plan before coding, always
2. **Incremental Development**: Build core foundation before features
3. **Plugin Systems**: Must be designed from day 1, not retrofitted
4. **Performance**: Comes from good architecture, not micro-optimizations
5. **Testing**: Should precede features, not follow them

### ⚠️ Production Use Warning:
This project is clearly marked as educational and NOT recommended for production use. All documentation includes appropriate warnings.

### 🚀 Next Steps:
The knowledge gained will be applied to NextRush v2.0 - a complete rewrite with proper architecture planning and incremental development.

## 📄 Files Changed:
- Updated README.md with learning project status
- Created LESSONS-LEARNED.md with comprehensive insights
- Created PROJECT-STATUS.md with final achievements
- Created EXIT-PLAN.md with closure steps
- Updated package.json description
- Updated copilot instructions for archival status

**Status**: Ready for archival as educational reference ✅
```
