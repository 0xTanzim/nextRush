## ✅ Detailed Tasks Breakdown

### **🧩 TASK 1 – Built-in Rate Limiting**

- Add memory-based (default) and Redis backend.
- Configurable with window, max requests, headers.
- Integrate with middleware pipeline (`app.useRateLimiter()`).

### **🧩 TASK 2 – Automatic CORS Handling**

- Expose utility `app.cors()` or `use(corsOptions)`.
- Smart defaults (`*`, allowed methods, credentials).
- Support per-route CORS override.
- - xssProtection() and other security headers.

### **🧩 TASK 3 – API Documentation Generator**

- Use metadata (or decorators) to auto-generate OpenAPI schema.
- Expose `/docs` route with Swagger UI.
- Allow plugin extension (tagging, auth headers, etc.).

### **🧩 TASK 4 – Auth Plugin (JWT, RBAC-ready)**

- Built-in support for JWT, session tokens.
- Strategy design: `useJwt`, `useSession`, `useRBAC`.
- Secure route guards, claims, permissions.
- Works with context-based auth policies.

### **🧩 TASK 5 – Async/Await Middleware Support**

- Enhance router/middleware engine to support `async (req, res, next)`.
- Ensure full error propagation through the pipeline.
- Add developer warnings for missing `await next()`.

### **🧩 TASK 6 – Hot Reloadable Plugin System**

- Dev-mode only: detect file changes in plugin directory.
- Reload plugin registry without restarting app instance.
- Useful for DX & long-running servers.

### **🧩 TASK 7 – Built-in Metrics & Monitoring**

- Track:

  - Request count, latency
  - Memory usage, heap stats
  - Plugin execution times

- Expose at `/metrics` endpoint
- Optional Prometheus support

### **🧩 TASK 9 – Request Pipeline API**

- Introduce `app.pipeline()` method
- Chainable structure: `pipeline.step(fn).step(fn)...`
- Improves readability of request processing

Would you like me to help:

- Create a GitHub Issues board based on this?
- Write each feature spec in markdown (`docs/features/rate-limit.md`)?
- Draft announcement or release blog?

Let’s go big with this — you're building something serious.
