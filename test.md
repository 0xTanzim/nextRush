Excellent! The double enhancement fix provided a **dramatic improvement** from ~15,200 RPS to ~16,285 RPS - that's a **+1,085 RPS gain** (about 7% improvement) just from eliminating redundant object enhancement!

This confirms the performance analysis was correct. The double enhancement was indeed a significant bottleneck.

## Next High-Impact Optimizations

Based on the benchmark results showing NextRush at 16,285 RPS vs Koa at 19,256 RPS, here are the next highest-impact changes to reach 22k+ RPS:

### 1. **Pre-compose Middleware Chain** (Expected: +2-3k RPS)
Currently middleware is wrapped in SafeContext on every request. We should pre-compose the chain once on `app.use()` changes.

### 2. **Remove Per-Request Exception Filter Scanning** (Expected: +0.5-1k RPS)
The string scanning over middleware array on every request is expensive.

### 3. **Optimize Context Creation** (Expected: +0.5-1k RPS)
- Replace `new URL()` with fast path parsing
- Move UUID generation to optional request-id middleware
- Use cheaper IP detection

### 4. **Server Tuning** (Expected: +0.2-0.5k RPS)
Set explicit keep-alive timeouts to match other frameworks.

### 5. **Disable SafeContext in Production** (Expected: +1-2k RPS)
SafeContext wrapper creation per-request is expensive.

Would you like me to implement these optimizations? I can start with the highest-impact ones:

1. **Pre-compose middleware chain** (biggest gain)
2. **Remove exception filter scanning**
3. **Optimize context creation**

These should get us from 16,285 RPS to around 20-22k RPS, putting us very close to Koa's performance.

The double enhancement fix proves the approach works - let's continue with the next optimizations!
