### Major Changes

- 793d596: **BREAKING**: Removed a batch of dead backward-compatibility aliases across several packages.
  Each had been superseded for at least one release and carried zero remaining internal use.

  **Adapters (`@nextrush/adapter-bun`, `-deno`, `-node`)**: removed the deprecated
  `ServeOptions.hostname` / `ServerInstance.hostname` fields. Use `host` instead — it was already
  the canonical field; `hostname` was accepted only as a fallback.

  **Adapters (`@nextrush/adapter-bun`, `-deno`, `-edge`)**: removed the `{Bun,Deno,Edge}BodySource`
  type/value aliases and their `create{Bun,Deno,Edge}BodySource` factory functions. Use
  `WebBodySource` / `createWebBodySource` from `@nextrush/runtime` — the aliases were pure
  re-exports pointing at the same implementation.

  **`@nextrush/core`**: removed the `createHttpError` alias. Use `createError` (same function,
  different name) from `@nextrush/core`, `@nextrush/errors`, or `nextrush`.

  **`@nextrush/errors`**: removed `ErrorContext` (use `Context` from `@nextrush/types`),
  `ErrorMiddleware` (use `Middleware` from `@nextrush/types`), and `catchAsync()` (it was a no-op
  wrapper — `return handler` — remove the call, your handler already works without it; async
  errors propagate to `errorHandler()` on their own).

  **`@nextrush/body-parser`**: removed the Node-stream fallback path — `BodyParserContext.raw`,
  the `RequestStream` interface, and the `BodyParserMiddleware` type alias (use `Middleware` from
  `@nextrush/types`). Body parsing now requires `ctx.bodySource`, which every current adapter
  (Node, Bun, Deno, Edge) already provides — this only affects a custom/third-party adapter that
  never implemented `bodySource`.

  **`@nextrush/helmet`**: removed `frameguard()`, the `frameguard` option on `helmet()`, and the
  `XFrameOptionsValue` type. `X-Frame-Options` is superseded by the Content-Security-Policy
  `frame-ancestors` directive, which every modern browser honors. Replace
  `helmet({ frameguard: 'DENY' })` with
  `helmet({ contentSecurityPolicy: { directives: { 'frame-ancestors': ["'none'"] } } })` (or
  `["'self'"]` for the `SAMEORIGIN` equivalent).

  **`@nextrush/cors`**: removed the `CorsMiddleware` type alias (confirmed zero real usage anywhere
  in this repo). Use `Middleware` from `@nextrush/types`.

  **`nextrush`** (meta package): re-exported `catchAsync` — bumped as a consequence of the
  `@nextrush/errors` removal above. `@nextrush/class` bumped patch since it re-exports
  `@nextrush/di` symbols that are unaffected, included only because its own test suite exercises
  `@nextrush/core`'s error re-exports.

  No migration tooling is provided for this batch — every replacement is a one-line rename or
  import-path swap (`frameguard` is the one exception, needing a CSP directive instead of a
  function call; see the table in
  [the upgrade guide](https://github.com/0xTanzim/nextRush/blob/main/apps/website/content/docs/migrate/upgrade-guide.mdx)
  for the full old → new mapping).

### Patch Changes

- eee4462: Reliability hardening: bounded teardown, deterministic streaming, and cross-runtime request-timeout
  parity.

  A reliability audit (`report/reliability/reliability-framework-review.md`) found three failure
  paths that only surface in multi-week, streaming-heavy production runs. All fixes are additive or
  observable-behavior-only; no existing public signature is removed or narrowed.

  **`@nextrush/core`**
  - `Application.close(options?: { timeout?: number })` — bounds total teardown time. Omitting
    `timeout` is byte-identical to today's unbounded behavior. A teardown unit that doesn't finish in
    time is reported as a `TeardownTimeoutError` (exported) in the returned `Error[]`, naming which
    unit timed out, instead of hanging `close()` indefinitely.
  - `Application.onClose(hook)` — new teardown-registration API for subsystems outside the extension
    system (stateful middleware, long-lived services). Runs under the same bounded, per-hook-isolated
    guarantee as extension `destroy()`, reverse of registration order.
  - `Application.isDraining` — new getter, `true` from the moment `close()` begins until teardown
    completes. Shutdown start and any teardown failure/timeout are now logged via `app.logger`.

  **`@nextrush/class`** — a throwing `onShutdown()` service hook no longer strands every later
  service's teardown; each hook is now isolated (errors collected into an `AggregateError`).

  **`@nextrush/adapter-node`**
  - Streaming responses (`ctx.sse`/`ctx.stream`/`ctx.ndjson`/`ctx.sendStream`) now settle
    deterministically when the client disconnects while backpressured — previously the handler's
    promise could hang forever, stranding any `finally` cleanup after the stream call.
  - Graceful drain now releases idle keep-alive connections at drain start (`server
.closeIdleConnections()`) instead of only at the force-close timeout, and advertises `Connection:
close` on responses completed while draining — both reduce shutdown latency.
  - `drainAndClose` now passes `shutdownTimeout` as the teardown budget to `app.close()`, bounding
    the whole shutdown, not just the socket drain.
  - The request-abort-detection path no longer uses the deprecated `req.on('aborted')` event.
  - A body read that is interrupted by a client disconnect now rejects with a typed
    `RequestAbortedError` (from `@nextrush/runtime`) instead of a generic `Error`.
  - A response that completes without an explicit `Content-Type` now always gets one.

  **`@nextrush/adapter-bun` / `@nextrush/adapter-deno`** — `close()` now passes the same teardown
  budget into `app.close()`, so a hung extension teardown can no longer hang shutdown past
  `shutdownTimeout` on these runtimes either.

  **`@nextrush/runtime`**
  - New `RequestAbortedError` export (a `BadRequestError` subclass) — the typed client-abort
    condition used by the Node adapter's body-read path.
  - New `deriveDeadlineSignal(parentSignal, ms)` export — derives a child `AbortSignal` that aborts
    when either `ms` elapses or the parent signal aborts, for per-operation deadlines built on
    `ctx.signal`.

  **`@nextrush/websocket`**
  - The heartbeat interval is now `unref()`'d, so a missed disposal no longer keeps the process alive
    after an otherwise-complete graceful shutdown.
  - New `createWebSocketExtension()` export — offers the WebSocket server as a self-disposing
    `Extension` (`app.extend(createWebSocketExtension())`), whose `destroy()` calls `wss.close()` on
    `app.close()`. The existing `createWebSocket()` factory is unchanged, for manual/advanced attach.

  **`@nextrush/health`** — `CheckFn` now optionally receives an `AbortSignal` that aborts when the
  check exceeds `checkTimeoutMs`, so a cooperative check can cancel its in-flight work instead of
  leaking an orphaned operation on every probe. Existing signal-less checks are unaffected.

  **`@nextrush/rate-limit`** — `rateLimit()` accepts an optional `app` field; when provided (and no
  custom `store` is supplied), the default in-memory store's cleanup interval is registered via
  `app.onClose` for deterministic disposal, instead of relying solely on its `unref()`'d interval.

  None of the above changes default behavior for an application that does not opt into the new
  options — `timeout`/`onClose`/`createWebSocketExtension`/the health `signal` parameter are all
  additive. The Node adapter's streaming-disconnect fix, idle-drain release, and `Content-Type`/typed-
  abort corrections are observable-behavior fixes on paths that were previously incorrect, not new
  opt-in surfaces.

## 3.1.0

### Major Changes

- d7eb075: Extension Model — replace the plugin system with Composition-First (RFC-NEXTRUSH-PLUGIN-SYSTEM).

  **Breaking changes**
  - **Removed the plugin system.** `Plugin`, `PluginWithHooks`, `PluginMeta`, `PluginFactory`, `ApplicationLike`, `app.plugin()`, `app.pluginAsync()`, `app.getPlugin()`, `app.hasPlugin()`, and the deprecated `app.onError()` setter are gone.
  - **New `Extension` contract** (`@nextrush/types`): `{ name, needs?, setup(ctx), destroy? }`, registered via `app.extend()` and booted at `app.ready()` (a deferred boot barrier that adapters call automatically before serving — eliminating the un-awaited-async-plugin race). Extensions decorate the app via the extension-only `ctx.decorate()`; `app.hasDecorator()` is the public read side. Error handling: use `app.setErrorHandler()`.
  - **App-owned router.** `Application` accepts `{ router }`; `app.get/post/put/patch/delete/head/all` delegate to it and it mounts last at `ready()`. `nextrush`'s `createApp()` injects a default router (batteries-included); `@nextrush/core`'s `createApp()` is bring-your-own-router. (No `app.options()` verb — it collides with the config property; use `app.all()`/CORS for OPTIONS.)
  - **Per-app DI container.** The container contract moved to `@nextrush/types` (`Container`); `@nextrush/di` re-exports it (the previous `ContainerInterface` alias has been removed — use `Container` directly). Each app owns its container (`app.container`, `createApp({ container })`), exposed to extensions via `ExtensionContext.container`.
  - **Package reclassification:** `@nextrush/events` → an Extension (`events()`); `@nextrush/openapi` → middleware (`app.use(openapi({ router }))`); `@nextrush/template` → middleware only (`templatePlugin()` removed); `@nextrush/controllers` → `registerControllers(app, options)` registrar (`ControllersPlugin`/`controllersPlugin` removed, `ControllersPluginOptions` → `ControllersOptions`). Adapter `serve()`/`listen()` are now async on Bun and Deno.
