### Patch Changes

- [#63](https://github.com/0xTanzim/nextRush/pull/63) [`4bdf830`](https://github.com/0xTanzim/nextRush/commit/4bdf8303cbeed3bf4351d035935c44d5110f8738) Thanks [@0xTanzim](https://github.com/0xTanzim)! - Opt-in lazy body parsing: `bodyParser({ lazy: true })` defers the read and the parse until the
  application calls `await ctx.readBody()`, so a request whose body is never read costs no body work.

  ```ts
  app.use(bodyParser({ lazy: true }));

  app.post('/hooks', async (ctx) => {
    const payload = await ctx.readBody<{ action: string }>(); // the only trigger
    return ctx.json({ received: payload.action });
  });
  ```

  Eager parsing remains the default and its behaviour is unchanged: same error codes, statuses,
  envelopes, `verify` ordering, and `rawBody` timing.

  On a request a lazy parser claimed, `ctx.body` throws `BODY_NOT_READ` until `readBody()` succeeds,
  so a missing await fails loudly instead of looking like an empty body. `readBody()` exists in both
  modes, reads the stream once, shares an in-flight read between concurrent callers, and caches a
  failure for the rest of the request. A write to `ctx.body` (a validation coercion, a terminal
  framework write) settles the body: a later `readBody()` returns the written value.

  `@nextrush/validation`, `@nextrush/class` guards and `@Body()` parameters, and `@nextrush/csrf`'s
  default extractor now consume the body through `readBody()`, so they work in both modes.

  **Implementer note (release classification).** `Context.readBody()` is a required member of the
  public contract. Applications are unaffected, but a custom `Context` implementation — an external
  adapter or a hand-written test double — must add it or stop compiling. Whether that warrants a
  major bump of `@nextrush/types` (and, through the fixed group, the whole framework) or a minor
  with a documented implementer note is a maintainer call; this changeset proposes minor.

  The evidence for the minor reading: every first-party context is either `WebContextBase`-derived (the
  Web adapters) or `NodeContext`, and both implement `readBody()` now. No package, example, or guide
  implements `Context` from scratch — the adapter documentation describes adapters as extending the
  shared base — so the break reaches hand-written test doubles and hypothetical from-scratch adapters,
  not applications. Adding a required member to `Context` also has precedent here (`ctx.cookies`,
  RFC-034). A major is still defensible if the project treats the interface as an implementable
  contract; the difference is a policy decision, not a technical one.

  Measured on Bun 1.4.4 with a 1 KB JSON `POST`: an unread lazy request drops from 9.39 µs to
  6.45 µs (−31 %); a request that reads pays ~0.4–0.5 µs more than eager. Details in RFC-047 §14.

## 3.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 0e2b399: Add `@nextrush/validation` — Standard Schema request validation middleware.

  Bring your own schema library (Zod, Valibot, ArkType, or any [Standard
  Schema](https://standardschema.dev) implementation) and validate `ctx.body`,
  `ctx.query`, and `ctx.params` with one function:

  ```typescript
  import { validate } from '@nextrush/validation';
  import { z } from 'zod';

  const User = z.object({ name: z.string().min(1), email: z.string().email() });

  app.post('/users', validate(User), (ctx) => {
    ctx.json(ctx.body); // validated + coerced
  });
  ```

  - `validate(schema)` validates and coerces the request body, overwriting
    `ctx.body` with the coerced value.
  - `validate({ body, query, params })` validates any combination of targets;
    `query`/`params` are validated but intentionally left unmodified so
    TypeScript's declared types are never wrong about them.
  - Every failure throws the framework's existing `ValidationError` (from
    `@nextrush/errors`), rendered by the existing `errorHandler` — no new error
    shape to learn.
  - Zero runtime dependencies.

  See the [package README](../packages/middleware/validation/README.md) for the
  full API and [RFC 004 — Validation](../docs/RFC/request-data/004-validation.md)
  for the design rationale.

- 32a0db6: Add the Route Metadata System — the framework-level foundation that lets any tool (OpenAPI, and later SDK/Postman/RPC generators) read a route's request/response shapes and documentation without duplication.
  - **`@nextrush/types`**: new `RouteDefinition` / `RouteMetadata` contracts and the `ROUTE_METADATA` contribution symbol. `StandardSchemaV1` moved here (from `@nextrush/validation`) as a shared contract.
  - **`@nextrush/router`**: new `endpoint()` metadata marker and `getRoutes(): readonly RouteDefinition[]` introspection. The router collects each route's metadata at registration by partitioning entries (functions run; pure markers contribute only) and merging contributions. Metadata lives in a side registry — the request hot path (`match()`, `HandlerEntry`, radix nodes) is byte-identical, and an interleaved A/B benchmark confirmed dispatch throughput is unchanged.
  - **`@nextrush/validation`**: `validate()` now contributes its request schemas via the protocol (non-enumerable internal marker — public API unchanged), so validated routes are documented for free.
  - **`@nextrush/controllers`**: class-based routes now contribute decorator documentation (`@Controller({ tags })`, `@Get/@Post({ description, deprecated })`) into their `RouteDefinition` via the same protocol, so controller routes appear fully documented in the spec alongside functional routes.
  - **`nextrush`**: re-exports `endpoint()` (and the `RouteDefinition` / `RouteMetadata` types) so it sits next to `createRouter` — `import { endpoint } from 'nextrush'`.

  Additive and backward-compatible: existing route registration and dispatch are unaffected.
